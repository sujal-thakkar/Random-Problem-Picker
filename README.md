## üîß Installation

Simply clone the repository to get started:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sujal-thakkar/Random-Problem-Picker.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Random-Problem-Picker

# Open in your browser
open index.html
```

No build steps or dependencies required! The application runs entirely in the browser using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## üí° Usage

1. **Open the application** in your web browser
2. **Click "Give me a question"** to get a random DSA problem
3. **Solve the problem** by clicking the link to access the problem on LeetCode
4. **Mark as complete** when you've solved it successfully
5. **Track your progress** with the visual progress bar
6. **Reset progress** if you want to start over

## üìù Customizing Problems

You can easily customize the list of problems by editing the `script.js` file. The questions are stored in an array at the top of the file:

```javascript
const questions = [
    {
        topic: "Sliding Window",
        title: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters",
        link: "https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/"
    },
    // Add your own problems here!
];
```

Simply add new problem objects to this array in the same format.
